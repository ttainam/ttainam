# Technologies and Skills

- Symfony/PHP: I'm a Symfony and PHP enthusiast, harnessing the power of this framework to create scalable and flexible systems. Through Symfony, I build the backbone of my applications, ensuring high quality and performance.

- Zend/PHP: Another toolkit I master is the Zend Framework. I use it when project complexity demands a more personalized approach, crafting highly adaptable and high-performance solutions.

- Python: In addition to PHP, I also have experience in Python development. I use this versatile language to create scripts, automate tasks, and build efficient applications.

- Vue.js: When it comes to crafting dynamic and interactive user interfaces, I turn to Vue.js. With it, I can create engaging and responsive user experiences, seamlessly complementing my back-end work.
